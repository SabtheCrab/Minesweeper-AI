# Minesweeper-AI

This is a minesweeper AI i programmed for my intro to AI class; it can solve about 50% of beginner and intermediate puzzles, but no expert ones. There are many files required to run this code, all of which are written by the TAs responsible the class. As such, I have decided to include only code I have written as a more accurate sample of my work.
